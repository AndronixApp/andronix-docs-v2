# SSH Server
We recommend that you use SSH Server from Termux instead of using it in a Linux environment. Using an SSH Server from
Termux gives you control of both your device and your Linux OS. We are providing you both the methods for the same down
below-

## SSH via Termux

You can follow [this](https://glow.li/technology/2015/11/06/run-an-ssh-server-on-your-android-with-termux/) link to get
to know the process of using SSH from Termux. This tutorial is provided officially by one of Termux developers.

## SSH via Linux

Since Linux is executed by using PRoot, it cannot override the default configurations of the Android connectivity, so
the port number needs to be changed. Follow the below steps to use SSH from Termux:
<Steps>
### Install OpenSSH
    Install **openSSH** inside Linux. Choose the command for your distro accordingly from the given list:
  
    #### Ubuntu 20
    
    ```bash copy
    apt install openssh-server nano -y
    ```

    #### Ubuntu 18
    
    ```bash copy
    apt install openssh-server nano -y
    ```

    #### Kali Linux
    
    ```bash copy
    apt install openssh-server nano -y
    ```

    #### Debian
    
    ```bash copy
    apt install openssh-server nano -y
    ```

    #### Manjaro
    
    ```bash copy
    pacman -S openssh nano --noconfim
    ```

    #### Arch
    
    ```bash copy
    pacman -S openssh nano --noconfim
    ```

    #### Fedora
    
    ```bash copy
    dnf install -y openssh-server nano
    ```

    #### Alpine
    
    ```bash copy
    apk add openssh-server nano
    ```

    #### Void
    
    ```bash copy
    xbps-install openssh nano
    ```

### Modifications
    Once OpenSSH server is installed on your Linux system, we need to modify some things to make it accessible in network escaping Android limitations. Now execute-
    
    ```
    nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
    ```
    
    * Find and change the line `#Port 22` to `Port 2222`
    * Find the line `#PermitRootLogin prohibit-password`  or `#PermitRootLogin yes` and change it to `PermitRootLogin yes` .
      If it is already `PermitRootLogin yes` then you do not need to change anything.
    * Now when you are done with all the above steps press `CTRL+X` and then type `Y` and then press `Enter`
### Generate Keys
    Now run
    ```bash copy
    ssh-keygen -A
    ```
    and then
    ```bash copy
    ssh-keygen
    ```
### Password
    Now we need to set password first. To set password type
    ```bash copy
    passwd
    ```
    and set any password.
### Start SSH Server
    Once this process is complete, just run
    ```bash copy
    /usr/sbin/sshd
    ```
    to start the SSH server.
    ### Connect
    Now just type
    ```bash copy
    ip a
    ```
    and copy the IP Address of `wlan`
    and to connect to SSH Server. To connect to SSH server type
    ```bash copy
    ssh root@localhost -p 2222
    ```
    and use the password to connect to the server.
