# Window Managers
According to the [Wikipedia Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_manager) for Window Managers, here's what they stand for:

> A window manager is system software that controls the placement and appearance of windows within a windowing system in a graphical user interface.[1] Most window managers are designed to help provide a desktop environment. They work in conjunction with the underlying graphical system that provides required functionalityâ€”support for graphics hardware, pointing devices, and a keyboard, and are often written and created using a widget toolkit.

In simpler terms, a **window manager is a program that deals with placing, removing, and just managing the placement of window**.

<Callout type="info">Some Window managers allow you to manage windows with your keyboard. These are the ones we are loosely referring to as Window Managers in this documentation.</Callout>

## Which WM should I choose?


You can pick whichever WM you like or you are familiar with. However, for the most part, we recommend going forward with a [Desktop Environment](/desktop-environments/desktop-environments) if you're new to Andronix. This is because operating WM without an actual keyboard can be unpleasant. That being said, if you're ready to explore, pick up **Awesome**.
