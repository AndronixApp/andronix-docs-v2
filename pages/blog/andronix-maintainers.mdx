<Callout type="info">Get paid to maintain Andronix. Please read the details below.</Callout>

Our team for the last 6 months has not been able to give Andronix the time it deserves. We have been busy with our personal lives and other projects. We have been trying to keep Andronix alive.
Hence we are looking for developers who can help us maintain Andronix. We are looking for developers who can help us with the following-

- **Maintenence of Andronix Open-Source Distros** - Andronix has a lot of open-source distros. We are looking for developers who can help us maintain these distros. This includes updating the distros, fixing bugs, and adding new features.

- **Maintenence of Androni Modded Distros** - We are looking for developers who can help us maintain the modded distros. This includes updating the distros, fixing bugs, and adding new features.

## How will you be rewarded?

In the event of a new **MAJOR VERSION** release of a distro, your task is to check for any issues labeled as "payout eligible." If identified, your responsibilities include creating the _root-fs_ for the release, packing it, thorough testing, and fixing associated scripts. Once completed, submit a pull request (PR) to the **AndronixOrigin** repository on GitHub, referencing the relevant issue. The contributor whose PR gets merged first for that major release will be eligible for the payout.


Payouts will vary based on the complexity of the release, with a starting base payout of approximately:

- **Andronix Open Source Distros**: ~45 USD per release
- **Andronix Modded OS (Closed Source)**: ~100 USD per release

Please note that these figures may be adjusted after assessing community feedback. We appreciate your patience as we finalize all the details based on the responses received. Your commitment to enhancing Andronix's distributions is truly valued.
