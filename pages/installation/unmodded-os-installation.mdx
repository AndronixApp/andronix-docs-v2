## 1. Preparation üöÄ

    <Imagera src="/images/install_new/install_distro_selection.jpg"/>
</Steps>
## 2. UI Selection ‚≠êÔ∏è

<Steps>
    ### Select
    Click on the distro that you would like to install.

    <Callout type="warning">We recommend you to get started with **Ubuntu** if you are overwhelmed by the
        options.</Callout>

    ### Select the UI
    Here comes the **UI Selection**
    <Imagera src="/images/install_new/install_gui_selection.jpg"/>
    <Callout type="info">Graphical User Interface or GUI is the visual interface that you interact with to do things in
        your
        Linux distribution.</Callout>

    <Callout type="info">Command Line Interface or CLI is the text-based interface that you interact with to execute
        commands and perform tasks in your Linux distribution.</Callout>


    <Steps>

        ### **Desktop Environment** <Badge>GUI</Badge>
        You can choose a Desktop Environment if you would like to use
        your mouse as well as your
        keyboard, or you've little or no experience with Linux. More
        information [here](../desktop-environments/desktop-environments.md).
        ### **Window Manager** <Badge>GUI</Badge>
        You can choose a Window Manager if you only want to use your keyboard
        to manage Windows and
        other OS-level tasks. These are pretty light and fast, but do require some skill before getting productive. More
        information [here](../window-managers/window-managers.md)
        ### **Command Line Interface** <Badge>CLI</Badge>
        If you don't want a Graphical User-interface, you can go ahead
        with the **Command Line Interface**. You'll have a terminal, which is enough if you know what you're doing in
        your session.
    </Steps>
    <Callout type="info">If you're confused in choosing one option, we would always recommend you to go with a Desktop
        Manager.</Callout>


    ### Continue
    Based on your selection above, please follow the respective instructions below:

    #### Desktop Environment

    Now that you've decided to go ahead with a desktop environment, let's select what desktop environment you would like
    to
    install. You can read [this page of the documentation](/desktop-environments/desktop-environments) to know more
    about different DE and then click on the one you would like to install.

    #### CLI

    Since you've chosen the Command Line Interface, there's no extra configuration required on your part. You may
    proceed
    to the instructions below.

</Steps>
## 3. Termux Execution üíª

<Callout type="warning">Please read this article to disable battery optimization for Termux so that processes running
    inside Termux don't randomly terminate.</Callout>
  <Callout type="info">If the installation appears to be stuck on a certain step for an unusual time, please press the
    **

## 5. VNC Configuration üì∫

<Steps>

    ### VNC Start

    Now the Start VNC server page should have opened

    <Imagera src="/images/install_new/install_start_vnc.jpg" />

    ### VNC Server

    In order for you to actually interact with the installed distribution's GUI, we will need to set up a VNC server.

    Follow this [comprehensive guide](/vnc/vnc-basics) to set up a VNC server and use your distro.

    <Callout type="error">If you are encountering the **Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter** error in Termux. Please read this article to resolve it- [Resolve Process 9 Error in Termux](/process-9-error-termux)</Callout>
