## Are we open-source? 📖🔓

Yes, and no. Andronix is partially open-source. The free distro (.tar) files and the shell scripts are available on
our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andronixapp). While all the paid things, like the actual Android app and all
the files concerning Andronix Modded OS, are closed-source for apparent reasons.

That doesn't mean that we don't love open-source, **we** ❤ **open-source**. If you're a developer or a maintainer of an
open-source project, **we will be more than happy to provide you everything for free** for life. Just get in touch with
us and complete the process of verification 😊.
