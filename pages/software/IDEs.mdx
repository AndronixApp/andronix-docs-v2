# IDEs
We love to code here, and Andronix is a portable computer. Why not use it to code anywhere? You can use full-fledged IDEs
inside Andronix.

<Callout type="warning">We have only tested VS code, IntelliJ Idea, IntelliJ DataGrip, MonoDevelop (tested GTKsharp, ASP
NET, ASP NETCORE this last have a problem with the target framework), Mono (In console, you can compile simple console
programs in C #) Net Core. You can test other IDEs and edit this page to add it to the list.</Callout>
