# Internal Storage
To mount internal storage you just need to run two commands.
<Steps>
    ### Termux Session
    * First open new Termux session (Swipe from left corner to right) and type:
    ```bash copy
    termux-setup-storage
    ```
    Now it will ask you for Storage permission. **Allow the Storage permission**.
    ### Open Start File
    * Once you are done with it type:

    ```bash copy
    nano start-(distroname).sh
    ```
    <Callout type="warning">Make sure to replace **(distroname)** with your specific distro name.</Callout>

    ### Search
    Now search for line:
    ```bash copy
    #command+=" -b /sdcard"
    ```
    ### Edit
    If you find this line, then remove it and change it to
    ```bash copy
    command+=" -b /sdcard"
    ```
    ### Add the line
    If you don't find the line then add the above mentioned line as shown in the screenshot below.

    <Imagera src="/images/strorage_ss.png"/>
    ### Save
    Once you are done with it press `Ctrl+X` and then press `Y` and then `Enter`. Now start your linux system and do
    `cd /` . Now you will be able to see a folder `sdcard` which means you have successfully mounted your Internal
    Storage.
