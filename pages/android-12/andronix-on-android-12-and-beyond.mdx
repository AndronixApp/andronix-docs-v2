# Andronix on Android 12 and beyond
Android 12 and the phantom process killer issue of Termux.
<Callout type="error">If you are encountering the **Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter** error in Termux. Please read the following article.</Callout>


## The Problem

Android 12 has added the mechanism to monitor forked child processes started by apps and kills them if more than the
default 32 are found running. In simpler words Android now monitors the number of child process which are spawned by a
particular app and if in any case it exceeds the number of permitted processes, it just kills them.

This has lead to a lot of power apps like Termux, Tasker, Andronix, Debian NoRoot, being broken on Android 12 and 12L devices.
There is nothing that can be done from our side since it's pushed in the Android's code.

### More Information

Issue on Termux's Repository:
[Android 12 Phantom Processes Killed (Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter)](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/issues/2366)

<Callout type="info">
The good thing being that Google has included a toggle to turn off the Phantom Process Killer in Android 12L or 13 but the OEMs like **Xiaomi, Samsung etc**. have not bothered to merge this change into their Android skins.
