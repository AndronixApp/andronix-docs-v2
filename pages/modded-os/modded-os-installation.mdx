# How to install Modded OS?
Installing Modded OS is a straightforward process. Here's how to get started quickly-

<Callout type="info">You are allotted a set number of downloads that are allowed in a day and a month. It is a very generous limit and shouldn't be hit by most users, but we can always help you increase it for a valid use case. It is strictly done to curb down the abuse of the downloading system. **You can see this limit on the OS information page of each distribution.**</Callout>
<br/>
<YoutubeEmbed id={"DW2g-I8gKDg"}/>
That information aside, we can begin installing the distro now. Follow the steps below-

## 1. Preparation üöÄ

<Steps>
### Open the app
Open the app and click on the **Modded OS** button on the dashboard. After you get into the Modded OS section, you'll see the various distros that you can install.

### Select the distro
Click the distro that you already own or are willing to buy. If you haven't already paid for it in the past, the app will show you the price and other information that you can refer and make the purchase. As soon as you complete the purchase, you can follow the next set of instructions.

</Steps>

## 2. Selection ‚≠êÔ∏è


<Steps>

### Install

You would see three buttons, one labeled **Install**, **Uninstall**, and **Download Quota**.
<Imagera src="/images/modded_install_new/modded_distro_options.jpg" />
### Finalize
As we are installing the distro, we will click on **Install**.
</Steps>


## 3. Termux Execution üì•




Now comes the part where the actual installation of your Linux distribution begins.




<Callout type="info">Andronix app has copied a command to your clipboard automatically. </Callout>



<Imagera src="/images/modded_install_new/modded_termux_exec.jpg"></Imagera>




<Steps>

### Termux

You will need to run/execute this command in Termux.
<Callout type="warning">Please read this before proceeding to make sure that you're using a compatible version of Termux for the installation process. Make sure that you've followed this guide for [Migration to F-Droid](/termux/migrating-to-f-droid)</Callout>

### Paste

Open the Termux app and **long press to paste the copied command and then hit enter to run it**.

<Imagera src="/images/modded_install_new/modded_os_command_termux.jpg"/>

### Wait

The installation/downloading will take some time. Please leave the Termux app running.

<Callout type="warning">Please read this article to disable battery optimization for Termux so that processes running inside Termux don't randomly terminate.</Callout>
<Callout type="info">You might notice unusual low speeds while downloading the distro tar file. You can ignore it because the file is simultaneously extracted while it's getting downloaded, and hence the process is slow.</Callout>
### Wait
Now, click the **Command Executed** button at the bottom of the screen.

### Finish
After the script has been executed successfully, Click the **Execution Finished** button at the bottom.
</Steps>

## 4. Starting Distribution ‚ö°Ô∏è



After the installation has been completed, and you don't see any errors at the end, we've made it to the last part,


configuring your installed distro! Now you need to **start the distro**.



<Steps>

### Start Command

You can start the distro by typing the following command in termux (Please choose your distro and execute the


respective command)-


* Ubuntu XFCE

```bash copy copy

./start-andronix.sh

```


* Ubuntu KDE

```bash copy copy

./start-androkde.sh

```


* Debian XFCE

```bash copy copy

./start-androdebian.sh

```


* Manjaro XFCE

```bash copy copy

./start-androjaro.sh

```


This will start the post-installation process i.e., setting up the essential packages. You will need to wait until this finishes.




### Select Region

If the post-installation setup is successful, you will see a menu to select the region. You can use the **arrow keys** as shown in the screenshot below to move the selection and hit **ENTER** to proceed forward.

### Select City

Once you have selected the region, you can choose your **City** in the following menu and proceed forward.

### Select Keyboard

Now you can select the keyboard layout if you have any specific layout other than the default English keyboard. We will go ahead with the English keyboard layout, so press **Enter** and proceed forward.



<Imagera src="/images/moddedos/modded_os_keyboard.png"/>



### Username

If everything goes perfectly, you will see a **blue screen** asking for a username. You can choose any username unless that's a reserved keyword like admin, root, etc. (your name works fine). Press **Enter** to proceed. <Callout type="info">If you can't access your keyboard for entering the username, press the ESC key at the bottom. Again, it restarts the script and this time, make sure that you have your keyboard out (click anywhere on the terminal) when you're in the Termux shell.</Callout>



<Imagera src="/images/username_user.png"/>



### Password

After the username, it's time to set up a password. You can choose any password as long as it is longer than 6 characters. Press Enter to proceed. Confirm the password by re-entering it and press Enter to continue.



<Imagera src="/images/pass_user.png"/>



### Root Password

Now you need a Root Password. You can choose any password as long as it is longer than six characters. Press Enter to proceed. Confirm the root password by re-entering it and press Enter to continue.




### Confirm

The next screen will show all the information entered. Check if those are the correct passwords and the username (if not, press the ESC or back button to restart the script). Press Enter to proceed.



<Imagera src="/images/confirm_user.png"/>



### Wait

Now, wait until the system is creating the user. You should see something like this while the system is setting-up the user.


<Imagera src="/images/user_creation_moddedos.png"/>


</Steps>


## 5. VNC Configuration üì∫

<Callout type="info">That's it! After this finishes, you will see- ```{your_username}@localhost:~$```</Callout>

<Steps>

### VNC Start

Now the Start VNC server page should have opened

<Imagera src="/images/install_new/install_start_vnc.jpg" />

### VNC Server

In order for you to actually interact with the installed distribution's GUI, we will need to set up a VNC server.

Follow this [comprehensive guide](/vnc/vnc-basics) to set up a VNC server and use your distro.

    <Callout type="error">If you are encountering the **Process completed (signal 9) - press Enter** error in Termux. Please read this article to resolve it- [Resolve Process 9 Error in Termux](/process-9-error-termux)</Callout>
